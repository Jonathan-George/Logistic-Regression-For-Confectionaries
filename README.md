# Logistic-Regression-For-Confectionaries

In this analytics project I determine wether or not a candy is chocolate, based on a number of independent variables, using the Random Forest Classifier Model.

I made use of the Candy Data on Kaggle...

My analysis produced a model of 94% accuracy, prediciting that a candy is chocolate on other features attributed to it.
